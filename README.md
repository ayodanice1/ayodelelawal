# 👋 Hi, I'm Lawal Ayodele

## Backend Engineer | Data-Driven Systems (Python • Flask • MongoDB • AWS • Qlik)

I am a **Backend Engineer** with 2+ years of experience building scalable backend systems, RESTful APIs, and data-powered applications. I specialize in **Python (Flask)**, **MongoDB**, and **cloud deployments on AWS**, with strong experience in **background task automation** using Celery and Redis.

I also bring solid experience with **QlikView and Qlik Sense**, where I design **data pipelines, optimized SQL extractions, and analytical dashboards**. This enables me to build backend systems that seamlessly feed analytics and visualization layers, ensuring products are both operationally robust and insight-driven.
